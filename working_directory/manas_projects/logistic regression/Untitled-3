load the data as a array 
what do i do about non numerical data 
shoudl i create a new xi column for every non mueric entry 
function
y # is the function
Y is the sigmoid fn 
y = wx+b
Y=sigmoid of y 

find gradiant discent of w 
impliment it with learning rate 
go through the entire data through iterations 
comute the enropic loss at every gradiant discent
